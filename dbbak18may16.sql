I have converted RS232 protocol to Ethernet using the ADAM device. \r\n\r\nThe set-up is like this:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n-	  At the AWS site\r\nIn the AWS box there is ADAM device( IP address for it is 192.168.145.222) connected on the AWS RS232 and the LAN Cable is also connected to the same device which is interfaced with PoE Adapter which is powered at the AC box next to the AWS box. The IP Radio(Bridgeâ€¦192.168.145.219)  is connected via the LAN to the PoE Adapter. I have configured the RADIOs is such a way that they donâ€™t lose configuration during power failure, I can give you the config file if you need it. For the ADAM device I have used Serial Device Server Configuration Utility software( The software is installed on the FAUT-AWS PC) to configure it.\r\n\r\nThe battery of the AWS is very poor and weak, I have asked Sisa to request one from Riaan. He will follow the relevant process. I was very hurt when I found out that the new AWS that I installed five days ago was faulty. All the RS232 ports are not working, the board didnâ€™t even have five 5 Volts and luckily I had the extra board that I was using for testing at P.E.  But on that board there is only one RS2329(i.e. 25 pin) that is working, which is the one I used. I also asked Sisa to request the new board from Irene so that they can be able to connect the Laptop when they do conformance. \r\n\r\n\r\n-	At the Office site\r\nThe set-up is slightly different. The IP Radio( Access Pointâ€¦.IP for it is 192.168.145.220) is installed where that Yagi antenna was and it is connected to the PoE adapter on the PoE port and the LAN port of the PoE adapter is connected to the network switch. WIDS and METCAP  for MTHATHA AWS is configured with the ADAM IP address. Makalima, the observers had problem with METAR which was not showing but I left Andrew sorting it out. Otherwise everything else is working efficiently. \r\n                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            \r\nNOTE:  Since the battery is weak, during power failure everything is going to go down and if one LAN will disconnected the whole link will fail. \r\n\r\n\r\nKind Regards\r\nDavis(Mr)Moshweunyane (Pr Techni Eng)\r\nSenior Technologist\r\nPE - South African Weather Service\r\nEmail:         Davis.Moshwe@weathersa.co.za\r\nTel no.: 041 581 1476/795\r\nFax no.: 086 602 7526\r\nWebsite:   www.weathersa.co.za\r\nâ€œWeather and Climate: Engaging youthâ€\r\n\r\n\r\n','2015-01-21','donald muller','OPS Technical','2014-11-18 12:10:03',''),(249,'Manual Raingauge','Preventative maintenance is due','2015-03-17 14:43:12','Rossouw','PM','New','completed',0,'Luyanda.Nanto','YES','2015-03-17 14:53:35','A trip will be taken on the 11/03/2015 to the station and the preventative maintenance will be performed accordingly','NO','closed','2015-03-18','yes','Preventative maintenance was performed accordingly','2015-03-18','Winston','OPS Regional Office','2015-03-17 14:43:34',''),(173,'AWS','Hum sensor faulty.','2014-11-24 09:06:46','Cradock-Mun','RM','New','completed',0,'Brent Appel','YES','2015-01-08 12:31:46','station to be visited.

The following was done. The Communication between the RCP board and ECU was restored.  The hand held device operation was restored. The wave guide was inspected and okayed for dirt and corrosion and wear and tear. The  railing of the platform one level beneath the dome was inspected and rust prevention recommended. The RCP boot sequence file got corrupted during the maintenance procedure and was replaced with a previous bootup sequence file. One profibus module on the ECU was found faulty and a replacement is necessary when the part is available. The final acceptance  documents was sign by Edward and Davis as representative of SAWS. A local UPS company was hired to do faultfinding on the faulty UPS and will proceed as soon as the administrative section between SAAB Grintek and the UPS company is sorted out. The Antenna Tags was done and the radar antenna performance  was found to be in good sound working order. The Diesel Generator was serviced by  a SAWS appointed company as well as the UPS was inspected. SAAB Grintek chaned the modification of the Cole  Hersee relay  and the automatic coming on of the generator was restored to its desired status of automatic switching on with the use of one battery when incoming ESKOM power cuts out. Batteries for UPS was recommended as well as replacement of the 5 yearly recommended Fans and Capacitors. The UPS company will use their own spares for repairs on the UPS.  a Smoke detector test was performed . At the Antenna Ghries was added to the Azimuth Gear Box.  It was observed that the Airconditioners goes off when the detonator of the Fire extinguishers detonate.
